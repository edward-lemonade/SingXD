So

to
waste
your
time
You
dont
have
to
waste
your
time
Hiking
up
a
hundred
hills
You
dont
have
to
but
I
will
Will
it
wash
your
hair
clean
When
your
husbands
all
die
Will
you
know
what
I
mean
Will
you
know
what
I
mean
Yeah
theres
a
horse
on
my
back
And
I
may
be
stomped
flat
But
my
loneliness
is
gone
All
my
loneliness
is
gone
Theres
a
horse
on
my
back
Gives
me
all
that
I
need

it
wash
your
hair
clean
When
your
husbands
all
die
Will

know
what
I
mean

know
what
I
mean
And

my
loneliness
should
stay
Well

are
holiest
that
way
Falling
apart

apart
Falling
apart

apart
Will
it
wash
your
hair
clean
Falling

apart
When
your
husbands
all
die
Falling
apart

apart
Will
you
know
what
I
mean
Falling
