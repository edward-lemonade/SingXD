I'll repeat what I say
But I'll never explain
So you don't have to waste your time
You don't have to waste your time
Hiking up a hundred hills
You don't have to, but I will

Will it wash your hair clean
When your husbands all die?
Will you know what I mean?
Will you know what I mean?

Yeah, there's a horse on my back
And I may be stomped flat
But my loneliness is gone
All my loneliness is gone
There's a horse on my back
Gives me all that I need

Will it wash your hair clean
When your husbands all die?
Will you know what I mean?
Will you know what I mean?

And if my loneliness should stay
Well, some are holiest that way
Falling apart, falling apart
Falling apart, falling apart

Will it wash your hair clean
(Falling apart, falling apart)
When your husbands all die?
(Falling apart, falling apart)
Will you know what I mean?
(Falling apart, falling apart)
Will you know what I mean?
(Falling apart, falling apart)
Will you know what I mean?
(Falling apart, falling apart)
Will you know what I mean?
Do you know what I mean?
